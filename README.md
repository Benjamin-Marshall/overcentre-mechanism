# overcentre-mechanism
This repository contains the CAD files for an Overcentre Mechanism. This is a tune-able and repeatable mechanism which can be used to mimic the forces experienced by a robotic system when tasked to extract a wedged object from the environment. 

# Whats in this repo? 

This repo contains CAD files (made using NX12) to design and manufacture an overcentre mechanism, which looks like this:

This can be used to test aerial manipulation control approaches. It can be easily adjusted for vertical or fully "3D" testing. An example of a vertical flight test can be seen in [1], which is shown below:

Further to this, [1] discusses the utility of the mechanism in the context of AM testing. An example of a controller which can smoothly manipulate the mechanism can be seen in [2], for which the experiment is shown below:

Of course, not all drones are the same size. For this reason, users may which to resize the mechanism for their available platforms. This process is detailed in [3], which will be added as soon as it is available.
